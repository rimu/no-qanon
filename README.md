# No-QAnon

An anti-fascist domains blocklist of QAnon, conspiracy, fake news, far-right and discriminatory websites.

By blocking the websites linked to hate groups and bad actors, it aims to defuse recruitment, propaganda and slow the spread of disinformation via tactics such as psyops, astroturfing, trolls, false flags, sockpuppeting, stochastic terrorism, FUD.

A domains blocklist only blocks entire websites: it's unfortunately unable to block anything on social media where radicalization often happens.
It will still definitely reduce exposition to false and harmful informations.
Fascists prey on the vulnerable so stay vigilant and consider also using a social media blocklist if needed.

## How to contribute

Clone this repository and add new domains in the appropriate `.txt` files in the `sources` folder. If you do not want to categorize, just put it in the `sources/default.txt` file and it will be blocked.

> For the `https://www.example.com` website, add `example.com` to the `sources/default.txt` file.

Then, when you push your changes to the `sources` folder, GitHub actions should kick in and automatically generate new versions of the blocklists. Should you want to generate them yourself, you can run the `scripts/update.sh` script (prerequisites : bash, python).

Finally, make a pull request: we'll review and approve it within a few days.

### Categorization

Blocked sites are organized using subfolders and `.txt` files in the `sources` folder. Use markdown (`.md`) files and comments (`#`) to add more information and references.

### How to contribute (easy mode)

If you have no idea how Git works, you can still contribute! Just [open an issue](https://github.com/rimu/no-qanon/issues) with the URLs you would like to add to the list, grouping them by language and categories if possible. We'll check and add them shortly.
